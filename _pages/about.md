I am a prospective PhD student at Southeast University (SEU), under the supervision of Professor Zhu Pengfei. Currently, I am a master's candidate at Northeastern University (NEU), about to graduate and expected to receive my Master's degree in 2025. I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Hebei University of Architecture in 2022.
